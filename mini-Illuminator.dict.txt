ཀ་ |   I. <consonant letter> The first of the གསལ་བྱེད་སུམ་ཅུ thirty consonants of the Tibetan language.  1) The enunciation of the consonant is defined as having: སྐྱེ་གནས place of production = the throat; བྱེད་པ producer = the throat; ནང་གི་རྩོལ་བ inner effort = inner connection of the throat; and ཕྱིའི་རྩོལ་བ outer effort = unaspirated and un-sounded.  2) i) When used as a མིང་གཞི name-base, the consonant is defined as a ཕོ་ཡིག "male letter" q.v.    ii) Due to that definition, when a མིང་མཐའ name-ending (i.e., a single-letter ending which is added to another word and becomes part of it) is required, of the three possible choices ka, ཁ, and ག, the letter ka is the one that must be used where a male letter ending is required.  A good example is the word gnyis; the ending letter is male so gnyis ka is correct not gnyis kha or gnyis ga.  However, the old form of the word gnyi, since it has a female 'a ending on it (it is invisible but there by the rules of grammar), gets a female name ending and becomes gnyi ga not gnyis ka or gnyis kha.  II. <ཚིག་ཕྲད phrase connector> Placed following other words to indicate i) the whole set that the word represents, everything associated with that word, e.g., 'di de gnyis means "the two things, this and that" whereas 'di de gnyis ka means "the two things, this and that, taken together as a whole".  In this usage it is used to form new noun-words, e.g., dpyid ka and stong ka are the words for spring and autumn respectively.  They are formed by taking the word that describes a period of time ("pleasant" and "going-empty" respectively) and then adding the connector ka to connote that period taken as a whole and hence, spring and autumn.  ii) It also commonly used to create a new noun that indicates that very thing, the culmination of something, e.g., འགྲོངས་ཀ the culmination of the death process which is the actual moment of death itself.  The word is created by adding connector ka to the verb for dying, 'grongs.  III. <noun> 1) Meaning the first, the earliest, the primordial one.  This usage is like the usage of the first letter of the alphabet in English, a, to indicate the first one, the first of a series, and the one at the beginning point.  Just as the Greek letter alpha is placed for this usage in English, so it is suggested that, in some circumstances alpha will be a good way to translate this usage of ka.  For example, in རྫོགས་པ་ཆེན་པོ Great Completion the term ཀ་དག Alpha Purity is a crucial term.  It means the purity (dag) which was there first, before anything else, so it is alpha-purity.  2) Used as an indicator of sequence number, like the English system of A, B, C, for marking volumes of books etcetera in which case it is the "1st".
ཀ་ཀ་ | <noun> 1) Corrupted form of ཀའ་ཀ q.v.  2) The ཨ་ཅུག of a sheep q.v.  3) [Dialect] The clothing of a young child.  4) Slang term for སྐྱག་པ faeces.
ཀ་ཀ་ཎི་ལ་ | Mis-spelling of ཀ་ཀ་ནའི་ལ q.v.
ཀ་ཀ་ནའི་ལ་ | <noun> The semi-precious stone "amethyst".  Note that amethyst is chemically related to the gem stone ཨཻནདར་ནའི་ལ "sapphire" q.v. and is therefore said in some Tibetan dictionaries (and Tibetan-English dictionaries literally translating the Tibetan ones) to be a darker form of sapphire.  However, the meaning in that case is amethyst, not sapphire.
